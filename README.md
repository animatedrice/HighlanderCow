Brings the fluffiest Scottish Highlanders to Stardew Valley! Your happiness will go up 400% when petting these cows ‚ù§ (scientifically proven)

Config setting options:
* ```HighlanderBreed```: true/false (default true). This enables the Highland Cow to be a different breed from the Brown and White cows (Think of the chance of getting a blue chicken). Disable this is you don't want this and only want the Highlander as an optional skin of the Brown cow.
